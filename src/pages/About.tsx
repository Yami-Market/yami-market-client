              Yami was founded by Alex Zhou. While studying in Kansas, he
              experienced the inconvenience of driving two hours to reach the
              closest Asian market. Thus, led to the making of Yami as he set
              out to help Asian Americans in the states that are facing the same
              difficult situations. Yami targets to provide the most complete
              and up-to-date selection of Asian products alongside with the best

              America and allow Asian culture and traditions to be preserved and
              spread in this foreign land.
